## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a key aspect of marketing that involves dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that share similar characteristics. This segmentation enables businesses to target different groups with tailored marketing strategies and product offerings. In this project, we use K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
* Customer ID
* Age
* Gender
* Marital Status
* Education Level
* Geographic Information
* Occupation
* Income Level
* Behavioral Data
* Purchase History
* Interactions with Customer Service
* Insurance Products Owned
* Coverage Amount
* Premium Amount
* Policy Type
* Customer Preferences
* Preferred Communication Channel
* Preferred Contact Time
* Preferred Language
* Segmentation Group


## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
* Handling missing values by filling numerical columns with the median and categorical columns with the mode.
* Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
* Standardizing numerical features.
* Customer Segmentation with K-Means
* The K-Means clustering algorithm is used to segment the customers. The steps include:


## Insights and Conclusions
From the customer segmentation analysis, we can draw several key insights:
* Younger customers tend to have lower incomes and opt for lower coverage, while older customers have higher incomes and opt for higher coverage.
* Older clusters can be targeted with premium, comprehensive insurance products.
* Focus on retaining high-value customers by offering premium services and loyalty programs.
* Design marketing campaigns to attract more customers from moderate coverage plans.
